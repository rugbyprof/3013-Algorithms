# Simple Compression Algorithms for Classroom Discussion

When introducing compression to students, it's helpful to start with a few algorithms that illustrate different principles and techniques. Below are several simple compression algorithms, along with key points that you can discuss in class:

---

## 1. Run-Length Encoding (RLE)

- **Concept:**
  - Replaces consecutive repeated characters with a single character and a count.
  - Example:
    - Original: `AAAAABBBCCD`
    - Encoded: `5A3B2C1D`
- **Pros:**
  - Very simple to implement.
  - Highly effective on data with long runs of repeated characters (e.g., simple images or monochrome bitmaps).
- **Cons:**
  - May increase data size for inputs with little repetition.
- **Discussion Point:**
  - When would RLE be an ideal choice? (e.g., compressing fax transmissions or simple graphics)

## 2. Huffman Coding

- **Concept:**
  - Uses a variable-length prefix code to represent characters.
  - More frequent characters are assigned shorter codes; less frequent ones get longer codes.
- **How It Works:**
  - Build a frequency table from the input.
  - Construct a Huffman tree using a min-heap (priority queue).
  - Generate binary codes by traversing the tree (left = 0, right = 1).
- **Pros:**
  - Achieves high compression ratios on text.
  - Guarantees a prefix-free code (no code is a prefix of another).
- **Cons:**
  - Requires storing the code tree along with the compressed data.
- **Discussion Point:**
  - Compare Huffman Coding with fixed-length encoding in terms of efficiency and practicality.

## 3. Lempel-Ziv Family (LZ77, LZ78, LZW)

- **Concept:**
  - These dictionary-based methods work by identifying repeated sequences of characters.
  - They build a dictionary of sequences as the data is processed and replace repeated occurrences with references.
- **Key Variants:**
  - **LZ77:** Uses sliding windows to find repeated patterns.
  - **LZ78:** Builds a dictionary of sequences on the fly.
  - **LZW:** A widely used variant (used in GIF and early compression utilities) that automatically builds a dictionary.
- **Pros:**
  - Does not require prior knowledge of the data.
  - Can handle a wide variety of input types.
- **Cons:**
  - More complex to implement compared to RLE.
  - Performance may vary depending on data characteristics.
- **Discussion Point:**
  - How do dictionary-based approaches scale with data size and diversity?

## 4. Shannon–Fano Coding

- **Concept:**
  - Similar in spirit to Huffman Coding, but it creates a code by dividing symbols into two groups with roughly equal probabilities.
- **Pros:**
  - Conceptually simpler than Huffman Coding.
- **Cons:**
  - Generally produces a slightly less optimal code compared to Huffman.
- **Discussion Point:**
  - Why might one choose Shannon–Fano coding over Huffman coding, despite its lower efficiency?

## 5. Other Concepts (Optional/Advanced)

- **Arithmetic Coding:**
  - Represents the entire message as a single fractional number between 0 and 1.
  - Provides compression close to the theoretical limit but is more computationally complex.
- **Context-Based Compression:**
  - Uses models to predict the next symbol, such as in Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM).

## Classroom Discussion & Activities

- **Comparative Analysis:**
  - Ask students to discuss scenarios where one algorithm would outperform another.
- **Mini-Projects:**
  - Have students implement a basic version of RLE or Huffman Coding in a high-level language.
- **Real-World Applications:**
  - Discuss where these algorithms are used today (e.g., image formats, text compression, network protocols).

## Summary

- **RLE** is best for data with many repeated characters.
- **Huffman Coding** is a classic algorithm that assigns variable-length codes based on frequency.
- **Lempel-Ziv methods** (LZ77, LZ78, LZW) are practical, dictionary-based compression techniques.
- **Shannon–Fano Coding** is simpler but less optimal than Huffman.
- **Advanced methods** (Arithmetic Coding) push closer to theoretical compression limits but at higher complexity.

This range of algorithms gives students a taste of different compression strategies and illustrates the trade-offs between simplicity, efficiency, and computational complexity.

Happy compressing!
