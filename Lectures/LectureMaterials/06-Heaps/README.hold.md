## Binary Heap Implementation - Array Based Implementation

### NEEDS SOME TWEEKING 

In this Heap overview, we assume **MIN** heap.

### Overview

In order to make our heap work efficiently, we will take advantage of the logarithmic nature of the
binary tree to represent our heap. In order to guarantee logarithmic performance, we must keep our
tree balanced. A balanced binary tree has roughly the same number of nodes in the left and right
subtrees of the root. In our heap implementation we keep the tree balanced by creating a **complete
binary tree**. A complete binary tree is a tree in which each level has all of its nodes. The
exception to this is the bottom level of the tree, which we fill in from left to right. The Figure
below shows an example of a complete binary tree.

- Another interesting property of a complete tree is that we can represent it using a single list. We do not need to use nodes and references or even lists of lists. 
- Because the tree is complete, the left child of a parent (at position *P*) is the node that is found in position ***2P*** in the list.
- Similarly, the right child of the parent is at position ***2P + 1*** in the list. 
- To find the parent of any node in the tree, we can simply use C++’s integer division. Given that a node is at position ***n*** in the list, the parent is at position ***n/2***. 
- The figure below shows a complete binary tree and also gives the list representation of the tree. 
- Note the ***2P*** and ***2P + 1*** relationship between parent and children. 
- The list representation of the tree, along with the full structure property, allows us to efficiently traverse a complete binary tree using only a few simple mathematical operations. We will see that this also leads to an efficient implementation of our binary heap.

## The Heap Order Property

  - The method that we will use to store items in a heap relies on maintaining the heap order
    property.
  - The **heap order property** is as follows:
> In a heap, for every node ***x*** with parent ***p***, the key in ***p*** is smaller than or equal to the key in ***x***.


## Heap Operations

### Getting Setup

Since the entire binary heap can be represented by a single array (efficiently), we don’t need to
keep track of much. Remember that since a heap is ALWAYS a complete tree, we never have empty slots
between stored values in our array. We really only need to keep track of the ***next available
slot*** (or ***currentSize***).

Also, we start filling our array at ***index 1*** since using ***index 0*** would have bad results
when calculating *left, right, and parent.* The figure below shows the relationship between each
binary tree entity when stored in an array.

### Insert

The easiest, and most efficient, way to add an item to a heap is to simply append the item to the
next available slot in the array. The good news about this is that we will ALWAYS have a complete
tree\! The bad news about appending is that we will very likely violate the heap structure property
(meaning we will have to re-arrange values).

Fixing any violations of the heap structure property can be done by comparing the newly added item
with its parent. If the newly added item is less than its parent, then we can swap the item with its
parent. The figure below shows the series of swaps needed to percolate the newly added item up to
its proper position in the tree.

| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------: |

Notice that when we percolate an item up, we are restoring the heap property between the newly added
item and the parent. We are also preserving the heap property for any siblings. Of course, if the
newly added item is very small, we may still need to swap it up another level. In fact, we may need
to keep swapping until we get to the top of the tree. The figure above shows the `percUp` or `bubbleUp` method,
which percolates a new item as far up in the tree as it needs to go to maintain the heap property.
Again, we use ***i / 2*** to find the parent and swap the values if the child is smaller than the parent.


### RemoveMin

Since the heap property requires that the root of the tree be the smallest item in the tree, finding
the minimum item is easy. The hard part of `RemoveMin` is restoring full compliance with the heap
structure and heap order properties after the root has been removed. We can restore our heap in two
steps.

1.  First, we will restore the root item by taking the last item in the list and moving it to the
    root position. Moving the last item maintains our heap structure property. However, we have
    probably destroyed the heap order property of our binary heap.
2.  Second, we will restore the heap order property by pushing the new root node down the tree to
    its proper position. The figure below shows the series of swaps needed to move the new root node
    to its proper position in the heap.

In order to maintain the heap order property, all we need to do is swap the root with its smallest
child less than the root. After the initial swap, we may repeat the swapping process with a node and
its children until the node is swapped into a position on the tree where it is already less than
both children.

### Heapify

To finish our discussion of binary heaps, we will look at a method to build an entire heap from a
list of keys. The first method you might think of may be like the following. Given a list of keys,
you could easily build a heap by inserting each key one at a time. Since you are starting with a
list of one item, the list is sorted and you could use binary search to find the right position to
insert the next key at a cost of approximately ***O(lg n)*** operations. However, remember that
inserting an item in the middle of the list may require ***O(n)*** operations to shift the rest of
the list over to make room for the new key. Therefore, to insert ***n*** keys into the heap would
require a total of ***O(n lg n)*** operations. However, if we start with an entire list then we can
build the whole heap in ***O(n)*** operations.

The figure above shows the swaps that the `Heapify` method makes as it moves the nodes in an
initial tree of \[9, 6, 5, 2, 3\] into their proper positions. Although we start out in the middle
of the tree and work our way back toward the root, the `percDown` method ensures that the largest
child is always moved down the tree. Because the heap is a complete binary tree, any nodes past the
halfway point will be leaves and therefore have no children. Notice that when `i=1`, we are
percolating down from the root of the tree, so this may require multiple swaps. As you can see in
the bottom most two trees in the figure above, first the 9 is moved out of the root position, but
after 9 is moved down one level in the tree, `percDown` ensures that we check the next set of
children farther down in the tree to ensure that it is pushed as low as it can go. In this case it
results in a second swap with 3. Now that 9 has been moved to the lowest level of the tree, no
further swapping can be done. 



The assertion that we can build the heap in ***O(n)*** may seem a bit mysterious at first, and
were not proving anything. However, the key to understanding that you can build the
heap in ***O(n)*** is to remember that the ***O(lg n)*** factor is derived from the height
of the tree. For most of the work in `Heapify`, the tree is shorter than ***lg n***.

Using the fact that you can build a heap from a list in ***O(n)*** time, you could easily construct a sorting algorithm that uses a heap and sorts a list in ***O(n lg n)*** cost.
