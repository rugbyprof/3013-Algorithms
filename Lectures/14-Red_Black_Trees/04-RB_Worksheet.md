## Red-Black Tree Practice
 
Consider the RB tree shown below to answer the questions that follow:

1.  Verify that the tree above does not violate any of the RB Tree properties.

2.	Perform the following insertions into the tree and perform the necessary color changes and rotations:

- 1 (case 2)
- 60 (case 3)
- 57 (symmetric case 4 - left of right child, followed by symmetric case 5 - right of right child)
- 65 (case 3, followed by symmetric case 5 on grandparent, node 57, requiring rotate on node 8)


Consider the RB tree shown below to answer the questions that follow:

1.  Does the tree violate any of the RB Tree properties?  

2.	Perform the following insertions and deletions into the tree and perform the necessary color changes and rotations:

- Insert 85
- Insert 55
- Insert 65
- Delete 10 (use predecessor replacement)
- Delete 75 (use predecessor replacement)
