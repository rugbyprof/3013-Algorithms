# Step-by-Step Explanation of the Hash Function Code

Below is a breakdown of the following code snippet:

```cpp
highorder = h & 0xf8000000    // extract high-order 5 bits from h
h = h << 5                    // shift h left by 5 bits
h = h ^ (highorder >> 27)     // move the highorder 5 bits to the low-order end and XOR into h
h = h ^ ki                    // XOR h and ki
```

### Step-by-Step List

1. Extract High-Order Bits
   - Operation: highorder = h & 0xf8000000
   - What Happens:
     - The bitwise AND (&) with 0xf8000000 (which in binary is a 32-bit number where the first five bits are 1 and the remaining bits are 0) extracts the high-order (leftmost) 5 bits from h.
     - Purpose: This isolates the top 5 bits for later use, preserving their information before shifting h.
2. Shift h Left by 5 Bits
   - Operation: $h = h << 5$
   - What Happens:
     - The left shift $(<<)$ by 5 bits moves all bits in h 5 positions to the left.
     - Result: This operation multiplies h by $2^5$ (or 32) and creates a 5-bit “gap” (zeros) at the right end.
     - Purpose: Prepares h to receive the previously extracted high-order bits at the lower end.
3. Move Extracted Bits to the Low-Order End and Mix
   - Operation: $h = h ^ (highorder >> 27)$
   - What Happens:
     - The extracted high-order bits stored in highorder are right shifted by 27 bits (highorder >> 27), moving them from the top of the 32-bit integer to the lowest 5 bits.
     - The XOR (^) operation then combines these 5 bits with the shifted value of h.
     - Purpose: This “wraps around” the high-order bits to the low end of h, ensuring that no information is lost and that the bits are mixed into h to improve distribution.
4. Incorporate the New Key
   - Operation: $h = h ^ {k_i}$
   - What Happens:
     - The value ki (representing a new key or part of the input) is XORed with the current value of h.
     - Purpose: This step mixes the new key into the hash value, further updating h to reflect the input data.

By performing these operations in sequence, the hash function ensures that: 
   - The high-order bits of h are preserved and integrated back into the lower bits. 
   - The resulting value h becomes a more uniformly distributed hash value, incorporating both the previous state and the new key $k_i$.
