# Proposed Slides for Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Intro

Below is an outline for **opening slides** that explain Dijkstra’s algorithm before you move into the detailed step-by-step walkthrough. Each slide includes suggestions for **images** or **visual aids** you might want to create or find.

---

## Slide 1: Title & Overview

**Title:** “Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Introduction and Key Concepts”

- **Key Bullet Points:**

  1. Purpose: Find the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative edges.
  2. Invented by Edsger Dijkstra (1956).
  3. Commonly used in routing, navigation, and network optimization.

- **Possible Image:**
  - A portrait of Edsger Dijkstra or a simple graphic labeled “Shortest Path in Weighted Graph.”

## Slide 2: Basic Idea

**Title:** “What Does Dijkstra’s Algorithm Do?”

- **Key Bullet Points:**

  1. Finds the minimum cumulative cost (distance) from a start node to all other nodes.
  2. Operates on non-negative edge weights.
  3. Uses a priority queue or min-heap to always pick the next closest node to process.

- **Possible Image:**
  - A simple example graph with edges labeled with positive weights.
  - Could highlight the start node (e.g., S) and show arrows to other nodes.

## Slide 3: Prerequisites & Assumptions

**Title:** “Assumptions & Requirements”

- **Key Bullet Points:**

  1. Graph Representation (adjacency list, adjacency matrix).
  2. All edges have **non-negative** weights.
  3. We have a **priority queue** data structure available (or can implement one).

- **Possible Image:**
  - A partial adjacency list or adjacency matrix.
  - Emphasize that edges must be >= 0 cost.

## Slide 4: Algorithm Outline

**Title:** “Dijkstra’s Algorithm Outline”

- **Key Bullet Points:**

  1. **Initialization**: Distance to start node = 0; all other nodes = infinity.
  2. **Priority Queue**: Start node enqueued with distance 0.
  3. **Main Loop**:
     - Extract min-distance node from queue.
     - Relax edges: update neighbors if a shorter path is found.
  4. **Result**: When no more nodes in queue, we have the shortest distances from start to all nodes.

- **Possible Image:**

  - A small flowchart:

    ```
    +-----------+       +-------------------+
    | Initialize|  -->  | Remove closest    |
    | Distances |       | from priority Q   |
    +-----------+       +-------------------+
             |                   |
             v                   v
       +------------------+      +----------------------+
       | Relax Edges to  | ---> | Update Distances     |
       | Neighbor Nodes  |      +----------------------+
    ```

## Slide 5: Complexity

**Title:** “Time Complexity & Efficiency”

- **Key Bullet Points:**

  1. With a binary min-heap/priority queue:
     - O((V + E) log V) typical bound.
  2. Explanation: Each edge is relaxed once; each node is extracted from the priority queue once.
  3. Balanced graph vs. dense graph implications.

- **Possible Image:**
  - Maybe a small table comparing `V = number of vertices`, `E = number of edges`, and complexity.
  - Or a bar chart showing O(E log V) vs. O(V^2) approaches.

---

## Slide 6: Use Cases

**Title:** “Where Do We Use Dijkstra’s?”

- **Key Bullet Points:**

  1. Navigation systems (GPS) for shortest driving routes.
  2. Network routing in computer networks.
  3. Game AI pathfinding (when edges are all non-negative).

- **Possible Image:**
  - A map or a simplified road network.

---

## Slide 7: Transition to Detailed Walkthrough

**Title:** “Now, Let’s Walk Through an Example”

- **Key Bullet Points:**

  1. We’ll use a specific graph example.
  2. Step-by-step demonstration of the data structures (priority queue, distance array).
  3. Final shortest paths from the chosen start node.

- **Possible Image:**
  - Brief preview or mini-version of the graph you’ll use for the detailed example.
  - Emphasize the “next slides will show each iteration.”
