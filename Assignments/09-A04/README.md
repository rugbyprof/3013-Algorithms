## COS - Celebration of Scholorship

#### Due: 04-25-2025 (Fri @ 5:00)

## Overview

Go over to COS and watch at least one talk today or tomorrow. Take a picture of your favorite poster, and a picture of the speaker during thier talk. Thats it.

## Deliverables

- Create a folder called `A04` in your `Assignments` folder.
- Create a README
- Upload pics and link to them with small description of what they are.
- Send to github.

## Example

This code:

```md
<center>
|                        <center>Creepy Baby</center>                        |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  <img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/f2/2c/PjYZue39_o.png" width="500">   |
| This is a creepy baby that was left in my front yard one night. Not lying. |
</center>
```

Makes this:

<center>
| <center>Creepy Baby</center> |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/f2/2c/PjYZue39_o.png" width="500"> |
| This is a creepy baby that was left in my front yard one night. Not lying. |
</center>

It's not on topic, but it shows you how you can display an image in a table with a title and description.
