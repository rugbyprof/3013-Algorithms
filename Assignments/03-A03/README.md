## Assignment 3 - BST Delete

#### Due: 02-03-2025 (Monday by 2:00pm)

## Overview

Using any resources you can find, even chat gpt, add a delete method to the binary search tree code we did in class.

In the readme file for this assignment list all the different cases and other things that need to be done to do a correct delete. This will make a little more sense when you look at a delete method as its more complicated than inserting or searching.

## Deliverables

- Create a folder called **A03** in your assignments folder.
- **ALL** files used in this project should be in that folder.
- Any source code YOU wrote (commented as directed [here](../../Resources/01-Comments/README.md))
