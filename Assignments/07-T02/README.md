## üìò AVL Trees Study Guide

‚∏ª

### üß† 1. Definition and Motivation

#### What are balanced trees?

- A balanced tree is a binary tree where the height difference between left and right subtrees is kept in check.
- In AVL trees, this means for every node, the height of the left and right subtrees differs by at most 1.

#### Why do we care?

- Because search, insertion, and deletion operations in unbalanced binary search trees (BSTs) can degrade to O(n) in the worst case (e.g., a degenerate tree that‚Äôs just a linked list).
- Balanced trees like AVL maintain O(log n) time for operations even in the worst case.

‚∏ª

### üå≥ 2. Introduction and Properties

#### Definition

- An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.
- Named after Adelson-Velsky and Landis, who introduced it in 1962.
- First tree-based structure that ensured balance after every insertion and deletion.

#### Balance Factor (BF)

- Defined as:
  $\text{BF} = \text{height(left subtree)} - \text{height(right subtree)}$
- Valid balance factors for AVL nodes: $‚Äì1, 0, 1$
- If the balance factor becomes $< ‚Äì1 or > 1$, the tree needs to be rebalanced using rotations.

‚∏ª

### üîÅ 3. Rotations and Rebalancing

#### Why rotate?

- Rotations are used to restore AVL balance after insertion or deletion messes it up.

#### Single Rotations:

1. LL (Left-Left): Heavy on left child‚Äôs left.
   - Fix with a right rotation.
2. RR (Right-Right): Heavy on right child‚Äôs right.
   - Fix with a left rotation.

#### Double Rotations:

3. LR (Left-Right): Left child is heavy on its right.

   - Fix with left rotation on child, then right rotation on parent.

4. RL (Right-Left): Right child is heavy on its left.

   - Fix with right rotation on child, then left rotation on parent.

#### Insertion Algorithm (high-level steps):

1. Insert as you would in a BST.
2. Walk back up and update heights.
3. Check balance factor.
4. If node is unbalanced, identify LL, RR, LR, or RL and rotate accordingly.

#### Deletion Algorithm:

- Similar to BST deletion.
- After deletion, walk up and rebalance where necessary.
- May trigger multiple rebalancing operations up the tree.

‚∏ª

### üìà 4. Performance Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| :-------- | :-------------- |
| Search    | O(log n)        |
| Insertion | O(log n)        |
| Deletion  | O(log n)        |
| Rotation  | (single) O(1)   |

#### Why O(log n)?

- AVL trees are always balanced, which means the height is logarithmic in the number of nodes:
  $h(n) \leq 1.44 \cdot \log_2(n + 2) - 0.328$

#### Compared to Other Trees:

- `Red-Black Trees`: Slightly faster inserts/deletes on average, but AVL trees are more strictly balanced ‚Üí better for read-heavy workloads.
- `Unbalanced BSTs`: Only good if data is randomly distributed (and even then, dangerous).

‚∏ª

### üõ†Ô∏è 5. Use Cases and Applications

#### When should I use AVL trees?

- When you need fast lookups and data is frequently read, not just inserted/deleted.
- Ideal for:
  - Databases where reads dominate.
  - Memory-constrained applications where predictable performance is critical.
  - Search engines, dictionary data, caches.

‚∏ª

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 6. Limitations

#### Rebalancing Overhead

- AVL trees do more work to stay balanced. After insertion or deletion, rotations and height recalculations may propagate up the tree.
- While each rotation is O(1), total overhead for an insertion or deletion can reach O(log n).

#### Memory Usage

- Each node stores extra height or balance factor info ‚Üí slightly more memory per node than basic BSTs.

#### Insert/Delete Speed

- Insertion and deletion are slower than Red-Black trees due to strict balancing.

‚∏ª

### üìù Sample Review Questions

1. True or False: Every AVL tree is a binary search tree.
2. What is the maximum allowed balance factor of a node in an AVL tree?
3. After inserting into an AVL tree, the balance factor of a node is ‚Äì2. What type of rotation is needed?
4. Why might AVL trees perform better than Red-Black trees for search-heavy applications?
5. What is the worst-case height of an AVL tree with n nodes?

Stay balanced, just like an AVL tree üòÑüå≤

## üìò AGraph Theory Study Guide

### 1. Fundamentals of Graph Theory

- Vertices and Edges
  - Vertices (Nodes): Fundamental units representing entities (e.g., cities, network nodes).
  - Edges (Links): Connections between vertices. They may represent roads, communication links, etc.
- Weighted vs. Unweighted Graphs
  - Weighted Graphs: Each edge carries a numerical value (weight) indicating cost, distance, or capacity.
  - Unweighted Graphs: Edges are considered equal; the focus is on connectivity rather than cost.
- Directed vs. Undirected Graphs
  - Directed Graphs (Digraphs): Edges have direction, meaning the connection is one-way.
  - Undirected Graphs: Edges imply a two-way, mutual relationship between vertices.

‚∏ª

### 2. Graph Representations

- **Adjacency Matrix**
  - A 2D array where the element at row i and column j indicates the presence (and possibly the weight) of an edge from vertex i to vertex j.
  - Pros: O(1) edge look-up.
  - Cons: Requires $O(V^2)$ space, which can be inefficient for sparse graphs.
- **Adjacency List**
  - An array or list where each element (vertex) holds a list of its adjacent vertices (and edge weights, if applicable).
  - Pros: Efficient for sparse graphs with O(V + E) space.
  - Cons: Checking the existence of a specific edge may take O(degree).
- **Edge List**
  - A simple list of edges, where each edge is a pair (or triple, if weighted) representing the connection between vertices.
  - Pros: Simple structure; good for algorithms that process all edges (like Kruskal‚Äôs).
  - Cons: Less efficient for neighbor queries.

‚∏ª

### 3. Traversal Techniques

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - Method: Uses recursion or an explicit stack to explore as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.
  - Applications: Cycle detection, topological sorting, and exploring connected components.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - Method: Uses a queue to explore all neighbors of a vertex before moving to the next level.
  - Applications: Shortest path in unweighted graphs, level order traversal, and checking bipartiteness.

- **Applications:**
  - Network design, clustering, and cost minimization problems.

‚∏ª

### 6. Connectivity and Components

- **Strongly Connected Components (SCC):**
  - In directed graphs, SCCs are subgraphs where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.
  - Algorithms: Kosaraju‚Äôs, Tarjan‚Äôs, and Gabow‚Äôs algorithms are commonly used.
- B**ipartite Graphs:**
  - A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex from one set to the other.

## üìò DFS Study Guide

### Concept and Intuition

- **How DFS Works:**
  - **Exploration**: DFS dives deep into a graph (or tree) by following one branch as far as possible before backtracking.
  - **Techniques:**
    - Recursion: Uses the call stack to remember the path.
    - Stack-based: Uses an explicit stack data structure to manage nodes.
- **Traversal Order and Backtracking:**
  - **Order**: In trees, DFS can be described as Preorder, Inorder, or Postorder; in general graphs, it simply explores one branch fully then returns.
  - **Backtracking**: When a node has no unvisited neighbors, DFS backtracks to explore other branches.

### Applications

- **Path Finding**: Explore paths in puzzles or maze-like structures.
- **Topological Sorting**: Order vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based on dependencies.
- **Cycle Detection**: Identify cycles in graphs by tracking nodes in the current recursion stack.
- **Solving Puzzles and Mazes**: DFS can efficiently traverse all possible paths to find a solution.

### Variants

- R**ecursive DFS vs. Iterative DFS:**
  - **Recursive DFS:** Cleaner code; however, it may lead to stack overflow for very deep graphs.
  - **Iterative DFS:** Uses an explicit stack, avoiding recursion depth limits.
- **DFS in Trees vs. General Graphs:**
  - **Trees:** No cycles to worry about, so DFS is straightforward.
  - **General Graphs:** Requires a mechanism (e.g., a ‚Äúvisited‚Äù set) to avoid infinite loops due to cycles.

### Complexity and Performance

- Time Complexity: $O(V + E)$ ‚Äî Every vertex and edge is explored once.
- Space Complexity: $O(V)$ ‚Äî In the worst case (e.g., a deep graph), the recursion stack or explicit stack may hold all vertices.

### Related Concepts

- **Graph Connectivity:** DFS can help determine connected components.
- **Strongly Connected Components:**
  - **Tarjan‚Äôs Algorithm:** Uses DFS to identify strongly connected components in a directed graph.

  - BFS is used in the Edmonds-Karp implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method to find augmenting paths.

### Variants

- **BFS for Trees vs. General Graphs:**
  - **Trees:** Straightforward level-order traversal.
  - **Graphs:** Must track visited nodes to avoid processing cycles.
- **Modifications for Weighted Graphs:**
  - 0-1 BFS: Uses a deque to process graphs with edge weights of 0 or 1, efficiently finding the shortest path.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $O(V + E)$ ‚Äî Each vertex and edge is processed.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(V)$ ‚Äî In the worst case, the queue holds all vertices at a given level, which can be significant for wide graphs.

### Comparison with DFS

- **Advantages of BFS:**
  - **Shortest Path Guarantee:** In unweighted graphs, BFS finds the shortest path.
  - **Level-order Exploration:** Useful for problems where the distance from the source matters.
- **Trade-offs:**
  - **Memory Usage:** BFS can consume more memory than DFS in graphs with a large branching factor.
  - **Implementation:** DFS is often simpler and more memory efficient in cases where path length isn‚Äôt critical.
