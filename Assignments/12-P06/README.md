#### 11597 - Spanning Subtree
[UVA problem- 11597](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=2644)


This is a straight up arithmetic problem. No graph traversals, just look at max edges in a fully connected graph to calculate the max number of subtrees that do not share an edge.

Read about graph edge counts in a fully connected graph: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph 

This problem took me maybe 10 minutes. Do not overthink it.
